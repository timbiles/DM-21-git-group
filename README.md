## Practice Git As A Group

- Create Project (already been done for you)  
- Clone repository into your own project folder  
- Git checkout -b branchName
    - This creates your own branch. That is what you will be working from. You will no longer write code in the master branch. 
    - You only need to use `-b` when you are first creating your branch.
- Yarn/npm install  
    - This should only be done when there are new packages to install, or the first time you clone the project.
- code...  
- Git add/commit  
    - Just like you are used to, you need to add and commit your code.
- Git checkout master 
    - This switches you to the master branch.
- Git pull
    - This checks for any other changes to master branch. 
- Git checkout branchName  
- Git merge master 
    - Merges any updates from master to your branch
- Yarn/npm i to check for new packages  
- Check for any conflicts. If none, you can move on.  
- No conflicts then git commit/push origin branchName  
- On the github repo, create a pull request.
- I (mentor name here) will double check for any conflicts and then merge  
- Checkout back to master and pull again  
- Checkout back to branchName and merge master  
- Repeat from 'git checkout branch'
